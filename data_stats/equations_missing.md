# Student Guide to Missingness Analysis Algorithms

## 🎯 What Is Missingness Analysis Really About?

Imagine you're conducting a survey about people's income and lifestyle habits. You notice something strange: wealthy people often skip the "income" question, teenagers frequently don't answer questions about alcohol consumption, and people with health issues avoid questions about exercise. These aren't random omissions - there are **patterns** in what's missing!

Missingness analysis is the detective work of understanding **why** data is missing and **how** those missing patterns might affect your analysis. It's not just about counting blanks - it's about uncovering the hidden stories that missing data tells.

## 🔍 The Three Fundamental Types of Missingness

Before diving into algorithms, we need to understand the philosophical foundation: **Why is data missing?**

### 🎲 **MCAR: Missing Completely At Random**
**The Idea**: Missing data is like a coin flip - completely random, unrelated to anything.

**Real Examples**:
- **Survey responses lost due to server crashes** (truly random technical failures)
- **Laboratory samples contaminated randomly** (equipment malfunction)
- **Random subset of questionnaires lost in mail**

**Mathematical Formalization**: 
$$P(\text{Missing} | \text{Observed data, Unobserved data}) = P(\text{Missing})$$

**Think of it like this**: Whether data is missing doesn't depend on the data itself - it's pure bad luck.

### 🎯 **MAR: Missing At Random (Conditional)**
**The Idea**: Missing data depends on observed information, but not on the missing values themselves.

**Real Examples**:
- **Men less likely to answer questions about emotions** (depends on observed gender)
- **Older people skip technology questions** (depends on observed age)
- **Higher education → more likely to complete surveys** (depends on observed education)

**Mathematical Formalization**:
$$P(\text{Missing} | \text{Observed data, Unobserved data}) = P(\text{Missing} | \text{Observed data})$$

**Think of it like this**: "I can predict who won't answer based on what I can see about them."

### ⚠️ **MNAR: Missing Not At Random**
**The Idea**: Missing data depends on the unobserved values themselves - the most dangerous type!

**Real Examples**:
- **High earners refuse to disclose income** (missing depends on the income value itself)
- **Severely depressed patients drop out of mental health studies** (missing depends on unobserved severity)
- **Poor students avoid reporting grades** (missing depends on the grade value)

**Mathematical Formalization**:
$$P(\text{Missing} | \text{Observed data, Unobserved data}) \neq P(\text{Missing} | \text{Observed data})$$

**Think of it like this**: "The reason it's missing IS the information I wanted!"

## 📊 Part 1: Basic Missingness Rate Analysis

### 🎯 **Simple Missing Rate Calculation**

**The Algorithm**: For each variable, calculate what fraction of values are missing.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
$$\text{Missing Rate}_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n I(\text{missing}_{ij})}{n}$$

where $I(\text{missing}_{ij})$ is an indicator function (1 if missing, 0 if present).

**Think of it like this**: "What percentage of people didn't answer each question?"

**Example - Survey Analysis**:
```
Income question: 40% missing     ← High missingness, investigate why
Age question: 2% missing        ← Normal, probably just oversight  
Name question: 0% missing       ← Required field, no missingness
Phone number: 25% missing       ← Moderate, privacy concerns?
```

**Interpretation Guidelines**:
- **< 5%**: Generally not problematic
- **5-15%**: Potentially concerning, investigate patterns
- **15-30%**: Serious concern, may bias results
- **> 30%**: Major problem, question data quality

## 🕸️ Part 2: Missingness Correlation Analysis

### 🔗 **Understanding Co-Missingness Patterns**

**The Question**: Do variables tend to be missing together?

**The Algorithm**: Create a binary "missingness matrix" where 1 = missing, 0 = present, then compute correlations between these binary vectors.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
Let $M_{ij} = 1$ if value is missing for observation $i$ and variable $j$, 0 otherwise.

$$\rho_{kl} = \frac{\sum_i (M_{ik} - \bar{M}_k)(M_{il} - \bar{M}_l)}{\sqrt{\sum_i (M_{ik} - \bar{M}_k)^2 \sum_i (M_{il} - \bar{M}_l)^2}}$$

**Interpretation**:
- **High positive correlation (0.7-1.0)**: Variables tend to be missing together
- **Low correlation (0-0.3)**: Variables missing independently  
- **Negative correlation**: When one is missing, the other tends to be present

**Real Example - Medical Records**:
```
Blood_Pressure ↔ Heart_Rate: r = 0.85    ← Missing together (same test)
Income ↔ Education: r = 0.60              ← Missing together (privacy concerns)
Age ↔ Blood_Pressure: r = 0.02            ← Missing independently
```

**Why This Matters**: 
- **High correlations** suggest **systematic patterns** (equipment failure, survey design issues)
- **Can guide imputation strategies** (if variables missing together, impute together)

---

## 🎯 Part 3: Jaccard Similarity for Missingness Patterns

### 💎 **The Jaccard Index: Set Similarity for Missing Data**

**The Problem**: Correlation measures linear relationships, but missingness is binary. We need a measure designed for sets.

**The Core Idea**: Treat each variable's missing data pattern as a set. How similar are these sets?

**Mathematical Foundation**:
$$J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|} = \frac{\text{Both missing}}{\text{Either missing}}$$

**The Algorithm**:
1. **For each pair of variables**: Count observations where both are missing (intersection)
2. **Count observations** where at least one is missing (union)
3. **Compute ratio**: intersection ÷ union

**Example Calculation**:
```
Variable A missing: Observations {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}     (5 observations)
Variable B missing: Observations {1, 3, 8, 10}       (4 observations)

Intersection (both missing): {1, 3}                   (2 observations)
Union (either missing): {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}      (7 observations)

Jaccard = 2/7 ≈ 0.29
```

**Interpretation Scale**:
- **J = 1.0**: Perfect overlap (always missing together)
- **J = 0.5**: Moderate overlap
- **J = 0.0**: No overlap (never missing together)

**Why Jaccard vs. Correlation?**
- **Jaccard**: "How often do they miss together vs. miss separately?"
- **Correlation**: "Do their missing patterns tend to move together?"

**Real Application - E-commerce Data**:
```
Credit_Card ↔ Billing_Address: J = 0.95    ← Almost always missing together
Age ↔ Income: J = 0.45                     ← Sometimes missing together  
Product_Rating ↔ Purchase_Date: J = 0.02   ← Independent missingness
```

## 🌳 Part 4: Clustering Features by Missingness Patterns

### 🎯 **Hierarchical Clustering with Hamming Distance**

**The Goal**: Group variables that have similar missingness patterns.

**The Approach**: 
1. **Represent each variable** as a binary vector (1 = missing, 0 = present)
2. **Calculate distances** between these vectors using Hamming distance
3. **Apply hierarchical clustering** to group similar patterns

**Mathematical Foundation**:

**Hamming Distance**: Count positions where vectors differ
$$d_H(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|$$

For proportional distance (0-1 scale):
$$d_H^{norm}(x,y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|$$

**Example Calculation**:
```
Variable A: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  (missing at positions 1, 3, 5)
Variable B: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  (missing at positions 1, 5)
Variable C: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  (missing at positions 2, 3, 4)

Hamming Distance:
d(A,B) = |1-1| + |0-0| + |1-0| + |0-0| + |1-1| = 1
d(A,C) = |1-0| + |0-1| + |1-1| + |0-1| + |1-0| = 4
d(B,C) = |1-0| + |0-1| + |0-1| + |0-1| + |1-0| = 5

Clustering Result: {A,B} cluster together (distance 1), C separate (distances 4,5)
```

**Clustering Algorithm**: 
1. **Start with each variable** as its own cluster
2. **Repeatedly merge** the two closest clusters
3. **Continue until** desired number of clusters

**Interpretation**:
- **Variables in same cluster**: Similar missingness patterns (same causes?)
- **Variables in different clusters**: Different missingness mechanisms

**Real Example - Healthcare Data**:
```
Cluster 1: {Blood_Pressure, Heart_Rate, Weight}           ← Physical exam variables
Cluster 2: {Income, Education, Employment}                ← Socioeconomic variables  
Cluster 3: {Lab_Test_A, Lab_Test_B, Lab_Test_C}          ← Laboratory variables
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **Guides imputation strategies**: Variables in same cluster might be imputed together
- **Reveals data collection issues**: Clusters might reflect systematic problems
- **Informs analysis approach**: Different clusters might need different handling

## ⚠️ Part 5: MNAR Detection Algorithms

### 🔍 **The Challenge of Detecting MNAR**

**The Fundamental Problem**: MNAR depends on unobserved values, so we can never definitively prove it. We can only find **evidence** that suggests it.

**The Strategy**: Look for relationships between missingness patterns and available information (target variables) that suggest the missing values themselves drive the missingness.

### 📊 **For Continuous Targets: Statistical Tests**

#### **🎯 Welch's T-Test: Mean Differences**

**The Question**: Do people with missing data have different target values than people with complete data?

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- **Group 1**: Target values where feature is missing
- **Group 2**: Target values where feature is present
- **Null hypothesis**: Both groups have same mean
- **Test statistic**: Welch's t-test (unequal variances assumed)

$$t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

**Example - Income Survey**:
```
People who disclosed income: Average age = 35
People who didn't disclose income: Average age = 55

T-test p-value < 0.05 → Significant difference!
Interpretation: Older people more likely to hide income (potential MNAR)
```

#### **🌊 Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test: Distribution Differences**

**The Question**: Do the two groups have completely different distributions (not just different means)?

**The Algorithm**:
1. **Create cumulative distribution functions** for both groups
2. **Find maximum difference** between the CDFs
3. **Test if difference** is larger than expected by chance

**Mathematical Foundation**:
$$D = \max_x |F_1(x) - F_2(x)|$$

where $F_1(x)$ and $F_2(x)$ are the empirical CDFs.

**Why Use Both Tests?**
- **T-test**: Detects mean differences (location shifts)
- **KS-test**: Detects any distributional differences (shape, scale, location)

#### **🎯 Logistic Regression AUC: Predictive Power**

**The Question**: How well can the target variable predict who will have missing data?

**The Algorithm**:
1. **Create binary outcome**: 1 = missing, 0 = present
2. **Train logistic regression**: Predict missingness from target
3. **Calculate AUC**: How well does target predict missingness?

**Mathematical Foundation**:
$$P(\text{Missing}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Target})}}$$

**AUC Interpretation**:
- **AUC = 0.5**: Target can't predict missingness (random)
- **AUC > 0.7**: Target strongly predicts missingness (potential MNAR!)
- **AUC > 0.8**: Very strong evidence of MNAR

**Example - Medical Study**:
```
Outcome: Depression score (higher = more depressed)
Missing: Dropout from study

AUC = 0.82 → People with higher depression scores much more likely to drop out
Interpretation: Strong MNAR evidence (sickest people leave study)
```

### 📊 **For Categorical Targets: Association Tests**

#### **🎲 Chi-Square Test: Independence Testing**

**The Question**: Is missingness independent of the target categories?

**The Setup**: Create a contingency table:
```
                 Target Category A    Target Category B    Target Category C
Missing = No            n11                n12                n13
Missing = Yes           n21                n22                n23
```

**Mathematical Foundation**:
$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j} \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$

where $E_{ij} = \frac{\text{row}_i \times \text{col}_j}{n}$ are expected frequencies under independence.

**Example - Education Survey**:
```
                High School    College    Graduate
Complete Data       100         150        50     (300 total)
Missing Data         50          30        20     (100 total)

Chi-square test p < 0.05 → Missingness depends on education level!
Interpretation: Different education levels have different response rates
```

#### **📏 Cramér's V: Effect Size**

**The Problem**: Chi-square tells us *if* there's association, but not *how strong*.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
$$V = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n \times \min(r-1, c-1)}}$$

where $r$ = rows, $c$ = columns, $n$ = total observations.

**Interpretation Scale**:
- **V = 0**: No association
- **V = 0.1**: Small effect  
- **V = 0.3**: Medium effect
- **V = 0.5**: Large effect

#### **🔗 Mutual Information: Nonlinear Dependencies**

**The Advantage**: Captures nonlinear relationships that chi-square might miss.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
$$I(X;Y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}$$

**Think of it like this**: "How much does knowing the target reduce my uncertainty about missingness?"

## 🎯 Part 6: Putting It All Together - The MNAR Detection Pipeline

### 🔍 **The Algorithmic Strategy**

```
For each variable with missing data:
    
    If target is continuous:
        1. Run t-test: Do missing vs. present groups have different means?
        2. Run KS-test: Do they have different distributions?
        3. Train logistic regression: Can target predict missingness?
        4. Calculate AUC: How well does it predict?
        
        If (p_ttest < 0.05) OR (p_ks < 0.05) OR (AUC > 0.7):
            Flag as potential MNAR
    
    If target is categorical:
        1. Build contingency table: Missingness × Target categories
        2. Run chi-square test: Are they independent?
        3. Calculate Cramér's V: How strong is the association?
        4. Calculate mutual information: Any nonlinear dependencies?
        
        If (p_chi2 < 0.05) OR (V > 0.1) OR (MI > 0.05):
            Flag as potential MNAR
```

### 🚨 **Threshold Justifications**

**Why AUC > 0.7?**
- **0.5-0.6**: Poor prediction (likely random)
- **0.6-0.7**: Fair prediction (weak evidence)
- **0.7-0.8**: Good prediction (moderate evidence) ← Our threshold
- **0.8-0.9**: Excellent prediction (strong evidence)

**Why Cramér's V > 0.1?**
- **0.1**: Small but meaningful effect size in social sciences
- **Conservative threshold**: Avoids flagging trivial associations
- **Practical significance**: Large enough to potentially bias analyses

**Why p < 0.05?**
- **Standard statistical significance level**
- **5% false positive rate** when null hypothesis is true
- **Balance**: Not too strict (miss real effects) or too lenient (too many false alarms)

## 💡 Part 7: Real-World Applications & Examples

### 🏥 **Medical Research Example**

**Dataset**: Clinical trial for depression treatment
**Variables**: Age, Income, Baseline depression score, Treatment outcome
**Missing**: 30% of participants dropped out before final assessment

**Analysis Results**:
```
Dropout vs. Baseline Depression:
- T-test p = 0.001 (those who dropped out had higher baseline scores)
- AUC = 0.78 (baseline score strongly predicts dropout)
- Conclusion: Strong MNAR evidence

Dropout vs. Age: 
- T-test p = 0.45 (no age difference)
- AUC = 0.52 (age doesn't predict dropout)
- Conclusion: Age missingness likely MAR or MCAR

Dropout vs. Income:
- Chi-square p = 0.03 (income categories differ)
- Cramér's V = 0.15 (moderate association)
- Conclusion: Moderate MNAR evidence
```

**Implications**: 
- **Baseline depression**: MNAR mechanism (sickest patients drop out)
- **Age**: Can be ignored or easily imputed
- **Income**: Moderate concern, consider sensitivity analysis

### 💰 **Financial Survey Example**

**Dataset**: Household financial survey
**Variables**: Age, Education, Income, Debt, Investment behavior
**Missing**: Income missing for 25% of respondents

**Analysis Results**:
```
Income Missingness vs. Education:
- Chi-square p = 0.001 
- Pattern: Higher education → MORE likely to skip income questions
- Cramér's V = 0.22 (large effect)
- Interpretation: Privacy concerns in educated populations

Income Missingness vs. Debt:
- T-test p = 0.03
- Pattern: People with higher debt more likely to skip income
- AUC = 0.65 (moderate prediction)
- Interpretation: Embarrassment/privacy mechanism
```

**Implications**:
- **Simple imputation inappropriate** (systematic bias)
- **Need sensitivity analysis** or specialized MNAR methods
- **Consider external data sources** for validation

## 🎯 Part 8: Common Misconceptions & Pitfalls

### 🚫 **"Missing = Random" Assumption**
**Wrong thinking**: "I'll just ignore missing data or use simple imputation"
**Reality**: Missingness patterns can severely bias your results if not properly handled
**Solution**: Always analyze missingness patterns before proceeding

### 🚫 **"MNAR is Untestable" Fatalism**  
**Wrong thinking**: "Since we can't prove MNAR, we can't do anything about it"
**Reality**: We can find evidence and conduct sensitivity analyses
**Solution**: Use multiple approaches and test robustness of conclusions

### 🚫 **"High Missingness = Bad Data" Fallacy**
**Wrong thinking**: "This variable has 40% missing data, so it's useless"
**Reality**: High missingness might be informative if it's MNAR
**Solution**: Analyze the pattern - sometimes the missingness IS the signal

### 🚫 **"One Test is Enough" Simplification**
**Wrong thinking**: "The t-test was significant, so it's definitely MNAR"
**Reality**: Multiple lines of evidence are needed for robust conclusions
**Solution**: Use triangulation - multiple tests pointing to same conclusion

### 🚫 **"Correlation = Causation" in Missingness**
**Wrong thinking**: "Missingness correlates with outcome, so missingness causes the outcome"
**Reality**: Both might be caused by a third factor
**Solution**: Consider confounding variables and alternative explanations
